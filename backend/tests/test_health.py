"""The baseline test the scaffold ships with.

The platform installs this tree and runs `pytest` against it, so there has to
be something green to run before an agent has written anything -- otherwise the
first real ticket cannot tell a broken change from a repository that never
worked.

The `client` fixture comes from conftest.py and carries a database of its own,
so these tests never touch the one the application is configured with.
